                Located at the Northeast Regional Park and locally known as Castle Payne, this 7,046 foot monster is a mostly wooded course that features a great mix of par 3, 4, and 5's.  

​

The narrow fairways encourage you to use the landing zones, emphasizing placement and shot creativity over distance.

We don't call it the Payne for nothing!

                This short, wooded course stretches along former fluvial terraces of the Cape Fear River. These old sand deposits create a scenic course with uphill lines, downhill lines, and lines along the ridges.
It's located off River Road, in New Hanover County.
It is a great course for beginners and for more advanced players looking to polish their short game or rack up on some aces.
